# saucectl TestCafe & browser profiles example

If you ever have the need to mock video streams, such as a webcam, the browser
needs to be configured accordingly. Firefox does not provide a browser arg to
enable all flags necessaryâ€”they have to be set via the profile settings.

This example illustrates how you can configure saucectl to make use of an
existing preconfigured browser profile.

## What You'll Need

The steps below illustrate one of the quickest ways to get set up. If you'd like
a more in-depth guide, please check out our [documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/dev/cli/saucectl/#installing-saucectl).

### Install `saucectl`

```sh
npm install -g saucectl
```

### Set Your Sauce Labs Credentials

```sh
saucectl configure
```

## Running The Examples

Simply check out this repo, navigate into `examples/browser_profile` and run the
command below :rocket:

```sh
saucectl run
```

## The Config

[Follow me](.sauce/config.yml) if you'd like to see how saucectl is configured
for this example.
